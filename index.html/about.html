      The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league
      in India organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.[1]
      Founded in 2007, it features 10 state and city-based franchise teams.[2]
      The IPL is the most popular and richest cricket league in the world and is
      held annually between March and May. It has an exclusive window in the
      Future Tours Programme of the International Cricket Council, resulting in
      fewer international tours occurring during the seasons.[3] It is also the
      most viewed Indian sports event, per the Broadcast Audience Research
      Council.[4][5] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event to be
      broadcast live on YouTube.[6][7] In 2014, it ranked sixth in attendance
      among all sports leagues.[8] Inspired by the success of the IPL, other
      Indian sports leagues have been established.[a][11][12] The IPL is the
      second-richest sports league in the world by per-match value, after the
      NFL.[13] In 2023, the league sold its media rights for the next four
      seasons for US$6.4 billion to Viacom18 and Star Sports,[14] which meant
      that each IPL match was valued at $13.4 million.[15] As of 2024, there
      have been 17 seasons of the tournament. The current champions are the
      Kolkata Knight Riders, who won the 2024 season after defeating the
      Sunrisers Hyderabad in the final.[16] In six years, the IPL's value has
      more than doubled, reaching $12 billion in 2024.[17][18] History Winners

      the Essel Group launched the Indian Cricket League (ICL), in partnership
      with IL&FS.[19][20] The ICL was not recognized by the Board of Control for
      Cricket in India (BCCI) or the International Cricket Council (ICC).
      Moreover, the BCCI was unhappy about its committee members joining the ICL
      executive board.[21][22] In response, the BCCI increased the prize money
      for its domestic tournaments and imposed lifetime bans on players who
      joined the ICL, which it considered a rebel league.[23][24] Foundation On
      13 September 2007, as the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 began, the BCCI launched
      the Indian Premier League, an annual franchise-based Twenty20 cricket
      competition.[25] The inaugural season was scheduled to start in April
      2008, commencing with a "high-profile ceremony" in New Delhi. BCCI
      Vice-president Lalit Modi, who led the IPL initiative, provided details of
      the tournament, including its format, prize money, franchise revenue
      system, and squad composition rules. The league, to be managed by a
      seven-person governing council, would also serve as the qualifying
      mechanism for that year's Champions League Twenty20.[
