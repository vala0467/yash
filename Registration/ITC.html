        Tobacco business and early years
"ITC Limited" was originally named "Imperial Tobacco Company of India Limited", succeeding Imperial Brands and W.D. & H.O. Wills on 24 August 1910 as a British-owned company registered in Kolkata.[17][18] Since the company was primarily based on agricultural resources, it ventured into partnerships in 1911 with farmers from the southern part of India to source leaf tobacco.[citation needed][19] Under the company's umbrella, the "Indian Leaf Tobacco Development Company Limited" was formed in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh in 1912.[20] The first cigarette factory of the company was set up in 1913 in Bangalore.[citation needed]

In 1928, construction began for the company's headquarters, the 'Virginia House' at Calcutta.[21] ITC acquired Carreras Tobacco Company's factory at Kidderpore in 1935 to further strengthen its presence.[citation needed] ITC helped set up an indigenous cigarette tissue-paper-making plant in 1946 to reduce import costs significantly. Then, a factory for printing and packaging was set up in Madras in 1949.[citation needed] The company acquired the manufacturing business of Tobacco Manufacturers (India) Limited and the complementary lithographic printing business of Printers (India) Limited in 1953.
